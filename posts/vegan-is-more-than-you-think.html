      <p>
        There is a common misconception that if you’re on a plant based diet, you are vegan. Today we are going to dive into the scope of veganism and why it is more than a plant based diet. I’ll be straight to the point: eating only a plant based diet does not make you a vegan. If you are going to zoos, wearing wool, riding on a horse then you are not vegan. Here is why:
      </p>
      <p>
        But who decides you’re vegan? Isn’t that gate-keeping? Veganism is about animals and their rights. It’s not an identity you hold for your own being. It is a belief that animals have their rights of bodily integrity, which includes the right of animals to live. You cannot touch their body without their consent [and since we don’t have the grounds of consent on animals, we have no right to touch] and they have right to determine about their life conditions, which includes you cannot captivate them for your own service. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Now when you say eating a plant based diet is enough to be vegan and you can ride a horse, that conflicts with our definition. Riding a horse is an action for humans favor, it has nothing to do with horses natural conditions. It’s purely serving for humans [which has parallels with slavery as well]. So when someone eats meat do you call them vegan? Why not? Because clearly murdering an animal is against their basic rights: right to live [freely]. So is riding a horse vegan? It is not, it is animal slavery and it conflicts with the right of freedom. It is not an action to protect horses’ natural environment, if it was, you wouldn’t riding them on their back. So one becomes vegan when they have the integrity to following vegan decisions as much as possible. If one choose to eat non-vegan cheese just because they like the taste, they are not vegan. 
      </p>
      <p>
        We call “cheese is not vegan” because production of cheese from animal milk is a violation of cows bodily integrity (think about when mammals produce milk? after they give birth. production of milk in the industry is clearly rape on cows bodies. what if we milk the cow in “natural” ways [nature doesn’t exist in terms of cows since we selectively breed them for years]? again you’re touching someone’s body without consent, besides the milk produced on cows breasts are for the baby calf, not for an adult human. humans are the only species on earth feeding from another species’ milk].
      </p>
      <p>
        So the actions determine what is vegan what is not. Something that goes against the animal rights is not considered as vegan. This is as simple as, let’s say women’s rights. Would you be a feminist if you’re only against the femicide the wage gap, but you still think women should not wear skirts or you believe women cannot be computer scientists? Your actions and beliefs as a feminist should be consistent with the equality. So what happens when you ride on a horse? How can you support the horse has equal basic rights with you, when you’re using it for your entertainment? How do you claim you care about animals when you’re wearing someone else’s skin or hair that supposed to be *their*, not yours? How can you claim you support animal rights when you are taking advantage of animals because you believe you’re superior? Even if you don’t believe you’re superior, non-vegan actions has roots with human supremacy, which is highly correlated with ableism, racism, colonialism, sexism, and many other types of discrimination.
      </p>
      <p>
        At this point it’s worth to note that veganism share roots with anti-colonialism. Not so long ago, humans would live around [X]% of the land. Today, humans making up 1% of the population lives in 99% of the land (does that sound familiar? hint: capitalism). We are invading the lands of others used to live. We are not the indigenous to all lands of the earth. This is obviously a parallel situation with colonialism.
      </p>
      <p>
        Keep in mind that none of us vegans are 100% vegan. In the world we live, many animals have to suffer just for us to reach decent food. When I eat some bread, I know that many bugs and rats had been killed during the harvesting of wheat. We do what we can do the best. Stick to local food, if you can grow your own food, and obviously do not wear leather or visit zoos those that only serve to your comfort or entertainment. Thinking that you shouldn’t go vegan because there is no perfect veganism is like saying you support capitalism because you’ll always in some ways be part of the capitalist system. Fight against it as much as you can. And remember, you have more capabilities than the world makes you believe. If you aren’t on a fully plant based diet, you can still opt for cruelty free products for your hygiene, and choose not to go to zoos or ride on a horse for fun. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The take-away is, veganism is more than just a plant-based diet; it fundamentally revolves around animal rights and taking the best possible actions to not violate their fundamental rights.
